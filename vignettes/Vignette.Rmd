# Introduction

Historically, fisheries management has relied on knowing a stock's unfished biomass. Then, if the estimated stock biomass is below the target biomass, fishing effort is allowed to increase; if not, effort is decreased to allow the biomass to rebuild. However, there is one major issue with this system - the unfished biomass of a fished stock is difficult to estimate, and requires a long time series of catch and abundance data. For smaller, newer, or data-poor fisheries, this can make estimations very inaccurate and lead to mismanagement. A decade ago, a new reference point was proposed by Drs. Babcock and MacCall, called the density ratio - with only 1 year of sampling, this reference point could allow for the adaptive management of even small, new, or data-poor stocks. 

However, another problem that is not addressed using this new reference point is the time it takes for populations inside recently implemented reserves to start to build back up and the population dynamics that are associated with this transition. 

For this project, I will replicate the results of her model, and then compare one of Dr. Babcock's most successful control rule with a new control that takes these transient dynamics into account.

While control rules 7 and 8 show a consistely high biomass, this is because they don't allow fishing effort to increase.
